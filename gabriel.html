    <h1>Colors</h1>
    <h2>How many different colors are there?</h2>
    <p>So how do we know there are 18 decillion colors? First of all, scientists 
    have determined that in the lab we can see about 1,000 levels of dark-light 
    and about 100 levels each of red-green and yellow-blue. So that's about 10 million colors right there.</p>
