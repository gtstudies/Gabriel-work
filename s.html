    <h2>Imformation About Cars</h2>
    <main>
       <p><br><br> Most automobiles are powered by an internal combustion engine. Fuel, usually gasoline or petrol, is burned with
        air to create gases that expand. A spark plug creates a spark that ignites the gas and makes it burn. This energy 
        moves through cylinders in which pistons slide up and down.
        <br><br>In 1886, Karl Benz applied for a patent for his “vehicle powered by a gas engine.” The patent – number 37435 – 
        is effectively the genesis of the modern motor car. Benz used three wheels, because he wasn't satisfied with the steering 
        systems available for four-wheeled vehicles at the time.
        <br><br>On July 3, 1886, mechanical engineer Karl Benz drove the first automobile in Mannheim, Germany, reaching a top speed of 16 km/h (10 mph). 
        The automobile was powered by a 0.75-hp one-cylinder four-stroke gasoline engine.

    <p><br><br>La Marquise is the world's oldest running automobile, as of 2011. It is an 1884 model made by Frenchmen De Dion, Bouton and Trépardoux. The car was a quadricycle 
        prototype named for de Dion's mother.</p>
