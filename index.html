        <h2>What was the very first car?</h2>
        <p>On January 29, 1886, Carl Benz applied for a patent for his 
            “vehicle powered by a gas engine.” The patent – number 37435 
            – may be regarded as the birth certificate of the automobile. 
            In July 1886 the newspapers reported on the first public outing 
            of the three-wheeled Benz Patent Motor Car.</p>
            <h2>What are cars powered by?</h2>
            <p>Most automobiles are powered by an internal combustion engine. 
            Fuel, usually gasoline or petrol, is burned with air to create gases 
            that expand. A spark plug creates a spark that ignites the gas and makes it burn. 
            This energy moves through cylinders in which pistons slide up and down.</p>
            <h2>What was the first car to hit 100 mph?</h2>
            <p>The first car to break 100mph was a 90hp Napier owned by a chap called S.E. Edge.</p>
